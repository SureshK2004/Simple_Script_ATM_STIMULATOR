# Simple Script ATM Simulator

A simple ATM simulator built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project simulates basic ATM operations such as checking balances, withdrawing, depositing, and user authentication.

## Features

- User authentication (account number + PIN)  
- Check balance  
- Deposit funds  
- Withdraw funds (with basic validation)  
- Transaction history (if implemented)  
- Error handling for invalid input, insufficient balance, etc.  

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+  
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `virtualenv`  

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SureshK2004/Simple_Script_ATM_STIMULATOR.git
   cd Simple_Script_ATM_STIMULATOR
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. (Optional) Install any dependencies (if present).
   Currently there are no external dependencies (standard library only).

---

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

You’ll be prompted to:

1. Enter account number
2. Enter PIN
3. Choose an operation (view balance, deposit, withdraw, etc.)
4. Follow on-screen instructions

You can also modify or add accounts in `accounts.json`.

## Project Structure

```
Simple_Script_ATM_STIMULATOR/
├── app.py
├── accounts.json
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

* **app.py** — main application script
* **accounts.json** — sample / persistent data store for account details (account number, PIN, balance)
* **README.md** — this file
* **LICENSE** — project license

---

## Configuration

* **accounts.json** — contains account records in JSON format. Example:

  ```json
  {
      "1234567890": {
          "pin": "1234",
          "balance": 5000
      },
      "9876543210": {
          "pin": "5678",
          "balance": 10000
      }
  }
  ```

  You can add, remove, or modify accounts as needed.

---

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**
   Upon start, the user is prompted for account number and PIN. The script looks up the account in `accounts.json` and validates credentials.

2. **Operations Menu**
   If authentication succeeds, a menu is displayed with options:

   * Check Balance
   * Deposit Money
   * Withdraw Money
   * Exit

3. **Transaction Handling**

   * **Check Balance** — simply display the current balance.
   * **Deposit** — ask the user for deposit amount, validate it, and add it to the balance.
   * **Withdraw** — ask for withdrawal amount, validate it (positive, multiple of currency unit, and ≤ balance), then subtract from the account.
   * Optionally, record transaction history (if you extend the script later).

4. **Persistence**
   After each successful transaction, the updated balances are saved back to `accounts.json`.

5. **Error Handling**
   Invalid inputs, incorrect PIN, non-existent account, insufficient funds, negative amounts, etc., are all handled with appropriate error messages.

## Demo

Here’s a sample session:

```
Welcome to Simple ATM Simulator

Enter account number: 1234567890  
Enter PIN: 1234  

1. Check Balance  
2. Deposit  
3. Withdraw  
4. Exit  

Choose an option: 1  
Your balance is: 5000  

Choose an option: 2  
Enter deposit amount: 2000  
Deposit successful! New balance: 7000  

Choose an option: 3  
Enter withdrawal amount: 3000  
Withdrawal successful! New balance: 4000  

Choose an option: 4  
Thank you for using this ATM simulator. Goodbye!
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
3. Commit your changes with descriptive messages
4. Push the branch and open a Pull Request
5. In your PR, describe what’s changed and why

Possible improvements:

* Add a transaction history per account
* Support multi-currency
* Add account registration
* Better input validation & user interface
* Use a database (e.g. SQLite) instead of JSON
* Add unit tests
* Logging, exceptions, etc.
